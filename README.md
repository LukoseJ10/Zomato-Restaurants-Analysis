# Zomato-Restaurants-Analysis
This project demonstrates how structured data analysis can drive meaningful business decisions in the restaurant industry. Through a mix of pivot tables, filtering techniques, segmentation logic, and custom formulas, we transformed a complex raw dataset into clear insights and strategic actions.
Key findings include: 
the identification of high-potential markets such as Indonesia, Philippines, South Africa, UK and the UAE
the influence of features like delivery and booking on ratings and 
the value of targeted pricing and curated cuisine strategies. 
By combining statistical rigor with interactive visuals, the project not only answers immediate business questions but also lays the groundwork for scalable, data-backed expansion strategies in emerging and mature markets alike.

From scattered rows to strategic clarity, this journey wasn’t about opinions it was about listening to data. What we found was a roadmap built on signals, patterns, and proof. Now, the story the data told us is ready to become action.
The result is a set of actionable insights delivered through a comprehensive, interactive dashboard that aligns with Zomato’s mission to bring better food for more people - thoughtfully, strategically, and efficiently.
